## Overview

Modeling pipelines in `R` occasionally result in fitted model objects that take up too much memory. There are two main culprits:

1. Heavy dependencies on formulas and closures that capture the enclosing environment in the modeling process; and 
2. Lack of selectivity in the construction of the model object itself. 

As a result, fitted model objects carry over components that are often redundant and not required for post-fit estimation activities. `butcher` makes it easy to axe parts of the fitted output that are no longer needed, without sacrificing much functionality from the original model object. 

## Installation

Install the released version from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("butcher")
```

Or install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/butcher")
```

## Butchering 

To make the most of your memory available, this package provides five S3 generics for you to remove parts of a model object:

- `axe_call()`: To remove the call object.
- `axe_ctrl()`: To remove controls associated with training.
- `axe_data()`: To remove the original training data.
- `axe_env()`: To remove environments.
- `axe_fitted()`: To remove fitted values.

As an example, we wrap a `lm` model: 

```{r example}
library(butcher)
our_model <- function() {
  some_junk_in_the_environment <- runif(1e6) # we didn't know about
  lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars) 
}
```

The `lm` that exists in our modeling pipeline is: 

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(lobstr)
obj_size(our_model())
```

When, in fact, it should only require: 

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
small_lm <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars) 
obj_size(small_lm)
```

To understand which part of our original model object is taking up the most memory, we leverage the `weigh()` function: 

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
big_lm <- our_model()
butcher::weigh(big_lm)
```

The problem here is in the `terms` component of our `big_lm`. Because of how `lm` is implemented in the `stats` package, the environment (in which our model was made) was also carried along in the fitted output. To remove this (mostly) extraneous component, we can use `axe_env()`:

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
cleaned_lm <- butcher::axe_env(big_lm, verbose = TRUE)
```

Comparing it against our `small_lm`, we'll find:

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
butcher::weigh(cleaned_lm)
```

...it now takes the same memory on disk as `small_lm`:

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
butcher::weigh(small_lm)
```

Axing the environment is not the only functionality of `butcher`. We can also remove `call`, `ctrl`, `data` and `fitted_values`, or simply run `butcher()` to execute all of these axing functions at once. Any kind of axing on the object will append a butchered class to the current model object class(es) as well as a new attribute named `butcher_disabled` that lists any post-fit estimation functions that are disabled as a result. 

## Model Object Coverage

Check out the `vignette("available-axe-methods")` to see butcher's current coverage. If you are working with a new model object that could benefit from any kind of axing, we would love for you to make a pull request! You can visit the `vignette("adding-models-to-butcher")` for more guidelines, but in short, to contribute a set of axe methods:

1) Run `new_model_butcher(model_class = "your_object", package_name = "your_package")`
2) Use butcher helper functions `butcher::weigh()` and `butcher::locate()` to decide what to axe
3) Finalize edits to `R/your_object.R` and `tests/testthat/test-your_object.R` 
4) Make a pull request!
